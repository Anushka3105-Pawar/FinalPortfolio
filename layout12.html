                    Mumbai never ceases to amaze me.
                    Recently, I went on a photo walk with  where we visited unexplored places in the
                    city. The walk began at the Kuan Kung Chinese Temple, which felt like a time portal in a small,
                    quaint lane. Amidst all the chaos of the city lies the Chinese community of Mumbai. The temple was
                    beautiful and peaceful. We also spoke with Mr. Liao, who was the sweetest. Through our conversation,
                    we learned a few things about the community and his experiences in Mumbai. While conversing, Mr.
                    Liao said,

                    "I have traveled to many countries, but I always come back to Mumbai because it feels like home."
                    This underscores how the city can make anyone feel at home, no matter where they come from; Mumbai
                    will always embrace you as its own. <br> <br><br>Software used: Ligtroom </div>
